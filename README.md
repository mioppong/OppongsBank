# Oppongs Fake Bank - React

I made this app because I am still in the process of learning how to use react native, I chose this because I wanted to learn how to use Redux as well.

## Getting Started

- Download files and unzip them
- run yarn install, and npm install

## Running program

- After the previous step, run the command below in the main project folder

```
expo start
```

## Future Work

- In the future, I hope to be able to add an online feature where you can authenticate and connect to an online database.
